# WOW Risk Dashboard

Streamlit-based analytics workspace for ingesting quarterly risk datasets,
harmonizing them across canonical schemas, and delivering five investigative
views:

1. **Real Estate PD US Heatmap** - CBSA-level choropleth with occupancy and property segmentation.
2. **Risk Rating Migration** - 2023 to 2025 transition analysis and top movers.
3. **Backtest (Realizations in 2024)** - Expected vs realized loss diagnostics.
4. **Macro Linkage** - Macro correlations and regression insights.
5. **Defaulted Cohorts** - 36-month pre-default event study.

The implementation roadmap follows the specification provided by the WOW team
and will be executed across multiple commits to highlight key milestones.
